Ten years ago today, I signed the Affordable Care Act into law. It protected preexisting conditions, cut the uninsured rate in half, and lots more. But it's still under political attack right when we need care the most. We have to protect it, build on it, until we cover everyone.	0
Sometimes it takes the wisdom and resilience of those who have been marginalized for all of us to remember the importance of community and mutual aid.	0

Politicians shouldn’t be picking their voters. Voters should be picking their representatives. But unless we act, the status quo will remain in states all across the country. Let's make sure maps are drawn fairly when redistricting happens again in 2021: 	0
Proud of all the Americans who showed up to vote yesterday, electing a set of hopeful, forward-thinking leaders primed to protect Medicaid, draw fair voting maps, and reduce gun violence. A great night for our country—one that’ll leave a lasting legacy.	0

Today’s the first day of open enrollment on  , and high-quality coverage might be more affordable than you think. Nearly 9 in 10   customers qualify for financial help—so if you or someone you know needs insurance, #GetCovered today.	0
One challenge will define the future for today’s young generation more dramatically than any other: Climate change. The millions of young people worldwide who’ve organized and joined today’s #ClimateStrike demand action to protect our planet, and they deserve it.	0
Just 16, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet’s greatest advocates. Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she’s unafraid to push for real action. She embodies our vision at the @ObamaFoundation: A future shaped by young leaders like her.	0

What truly makes our country great is its diversity. I’ve seen that beauty in so many ways over the years. Whether we are born here or seek refuge here, there’s a place for us all. We must remember it’s not my America or your America. It’s our America.	0
50 years ago, history was written at the Stonewall Inn when New York's LGBT community stood up, spoke out, and started a movement. In 2016 I was proud to designate it as a national monument—a reminder the arc of our history is an arc of progress as long as we keep pushing for it.	0

Outside the Oval Office, I kept a painting of a small crowd huddled around a pocketwatch, waiting for the moment the Emancipation Proclamation took effect. On Juneteenth, we celebrate the anniversary of that news - freedom - reaching slaves in Texas. And something more:	0

Few, if any, men have had as great an impact on so many as Billy Graham. He was a strong voice for not only the Christian faith, but for basic human decency, as shown by his strident opposition to segregation.  He was America’s pastor.  Rest in Peace, Reverend Graham.	1
